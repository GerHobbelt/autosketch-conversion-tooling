Welcome

This limited release of AutoSketch has been provided for file
conversion purposes only.  All functionality other than opening
and saving files has been removed from this release.

Please follow the steps below to perform a drawing file conversion
for files created in AutoSketch Release 2.0 for Windows, or
earlier.  Once drawing files have been converted, you will be able
to open them in AutoSketch Release 5.0 and later.

To open a drawing file in AutoSketch 2.1fc   
1   On the File menu, click Open.
2   Double-click the icon that represents the file you want to open,
or select the file on the Active File drop-down list box, and
click OK.  The file appears in the drawing window.

Once you have opened an AutoSketch Release 2.0 for Windows or
earlier drawing file in AutoSketch 2.1, you need to resave the
file.  Saving the file in AutoSketch 2.1fc automatically updates
the file.  Once the file is saved as a 2.1fc file, simply follow
the instructions in AutoSketch Release 5.0 or later online Help to
open the file.

To save a drawing file in AutoSketch Release 2.1fc
1   On the File menu, click Save As.
